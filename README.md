The metaverse is a set of digital spaces, including 3D spaces, to socialize, learn, collaborate, play and more. Itâ€™s also common for metaverse platforms to create their own versions of cryptocurrency. For example, the popular NFT art collection marketplace, etc.

In the metaverse, users are represented by avatars, which are digital representations of themselves. These avatars can move, interact, and engage with the digital environment and other users. This allows for a wide range of experiences, from social gatherings and meetings to gaming, education, commerce, and much more.
